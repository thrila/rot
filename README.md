# ROT

a simple encoder and decoder using chracter substitution

 - text -> binary -> my format
 - my format -> binary -> text

 encoder (-e flag)-> change ascii to binary -> look up the binary in the table and return the value
decoder (-e flag)-> change ascii to binary -> look up the binary in the table with my mappings return the value
 ## how it should work

(encryption)
i want to be able to enter a file name add -e for encrypt and have a file with the encrypted text
(decryption)
enter file name -d and have it spit out decrypted file
